Jack-In-The-Box (Shulker): The Jack-In-The-Box is the main mob block which you will need to find or spawn in order to spawn any of the Plant VS Zombie mobs. Every time a cow is spawned in the Overworld there is a 30% that it will turn into a Jack-In-The-Box. They can also be found in the End since it replaces the shulker. You can then use a dye to transform it into any of the Plant VS Zombie mobs.",
